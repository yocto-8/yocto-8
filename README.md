# yocto-8

A pico-8 console based on the Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040 using a custom and optimized implementation.  
This does not aim to be a replacement of pico-8 and will not include any editor tools (in current plans anyway).  
This is currently in its very early stages.

yocto = picoÂ².

# Current progress

**Pretty much nothing is done, both on the software and hardware side.**

# Why?

This is an excellent question.

# Hardware requirements

The project aims to make use of the following bare-minimum requirements:
- A Raspberry Pi Pico.
- A SSD1351 SPI OLED display (128x128). Using cheaper or larger LCD modules should be feasible.
- An I2S DAC/amp with a speaker or a 3.5" jack plug, for audio support. Audio through PWM could be done, but I don't know what audio quality you'd get.
- At least 2MB of SPI RAM (as "lua memory" for the pico-8 is 2MB), e.g. ESP-PSRAM64H (64mbit PSRAM). I do not know exactly how those Lua memory constraints work in Pico-8 for now, so the 8MB PSRAM IC is probably good to be on the safe side depending on how the Lua implementation turns out.
- A bunch of buttons for input.
- You probably want a battery of some sort to power everything up - I use a cheap Li-Po battery with a lithium battery charge controller and feed this into the Pico (as it has a buck converter) and power the rest through the 3V3 output.

# Should I use this over something based on a Raspberry Pi Zero (or any similar SBC)?

Probably not, this solution is barely cheaper but may have a few differences:
- Power draw would _probably_ be better than what you would get with an SBC.
- This will not be as stable as the real thing.
- You won't get the full pico-8 experience.
- Getting those PSRAM modules is a pain in the ass in the EU. ESP-PSRAM64H on aliexpress was the only good option I found which is not really a good sign.
- But hey, it's going to look cool. Hopefully. If I even have the motivation to do progress past the 3 first days. `"A" * 9999`

This is not really intended to be practical, though.

# Design challenges

I can imagine a few:
- Memory requirements are probably the largest issue. The pico-8 "CPU" "RAM" easily fits into the RP2040 SRAM, and the rest of the runtime should not be much of a problem wrt RAM requirements. Lua memory (which seems to be for the program + any lua allocs), on the other hand, can apparently reach 2MB. This is absolutely not going to fit in the RP2040 SRAM, hence the SPI RAM requirement - I am thinking of doing some sort of caching with the remaining SRAM and swap to/back from the SPI RAM as required. I do not know whether this will be fast enough.
- Lua will need to be patched heavily to provide compat with pico-8 lua because of the above point and due to a [significant number of changes done in pico-8](https://gist.github.com/josefnpat/bfe4aaa5bbb44f572cd0).
- Some level of optimization will probably be required to run the pico-8 at full speed. Looking at the pico-8 "CPU" timings it seems quite feasible. Regardless, squeezing as much performance as possible is interesting in the scope of this project as power draw scales with the CPU frequency somewhat, and a lower power draw is nice when running off a battery. I have _no idea_ how the battery lifetime would turn out for, say, the 3.7V 1800mAh battery I got, but it should hopefully be good.
- I haven't thought or cared about mouse support for now.

## PSRAM handling

It is currently unclear how to even use the external RAM. The most obvious solution is to rewrite the Lua VM to allow this, but this is of course complicated.

An extremely cursed idea I had was to handle faults caused by unmapped accesses within some dedicated memory region, because we do not have any form of address translation available on the RP2040 (apparently).  
However, such faults do not seem to provide much if any information in related registers at all. Emulating the faulting instruction will likely require disassembling it and handling the memory transaction (through some cache for the PSRAM and swapping if needed).  
This appears to be _really_ slow but I'm not sure how much can be done otherwise TBH. To my understanding the overhead would be:
- Causing the fault itself (as it has to push regs onto the stack for the fault handler)
- Checking whether the address is a hit in the PSRAM cache. If not then this overhead won't matter very much as we need to start a whole transfer for that (we could DMA writes for pages that should be swapped back too as an optimization but lol whatever at this point)
- Dispatch depending on opcode
- Perform memory transaction
- Returning and restoring state

Now, as to whether this way too garbage or not...

The original idea was to use the MPU to cause the faults but that does not seem to be very required really?
